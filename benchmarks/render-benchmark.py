Updated 2026-10-27. **† PNG rows** use the qualified 0.2.1 development producer;
the other 27 controls retain the published 0.2.0 measurements on unchanged paths.
The original 31-control release evidence remains immutable. Full CPU parity and
general replacement readiness remain open.

Measurements use the dedicated quiet Ubuntu 24.04 x64 VM
({evidence['machine']['cpuModel']}): one pinned CPU per operation, warm .NET 10,
sequential Release execution, no concurrency. This representative scope is not
the full performance objective.

Stored PNG16 independently confirms 12 measured iterations; other rows are short
BenchmarkDotNet screens with three. Native brackets before/after and idle/process
guards pass. The stored control improved from 1,112.30 to 426.14 µs and now measures
1.052× reference time (upper 1.067×); full parity remains open.
Ratio uses the faster native bracket; upper is the conservative confidence bound
including unfiltered managed samples. Short screens are not new independent
parity confirmations. B/op measures managed allocation, not native
allocation, peak live memory or cooperative-admission charges.

Operations include normalization, input delivery and independently owned output;
async encoding includes staging/delivery/release. Fixture preparation is excluded.
Source images are 513×259; resize rows state output dimensions. The
[release evidence](../benchmarks/release-0.2.0-benchmark-evidence.json) and
[stored-PNG round](../benchmarks/WARM-PNG-BULK-STORED.md) record exact dimensions,
settings, boundaries, binaries, samples, package checks and retained raw archives.

''' + codecs + '''

Packets pass existing complete-byte gates; color JPEG differs only by the approved
two-byte-smaller attribution COM. Lossless pixels, lossy reconstruction and alpha
gates remain enforced. [Codec parity](codec-parity.md) gives the broader frozen
control scope. These measurements make no arbitrary-content compression claim.

''' + editing + '''

Resize references use FFmpeg or its explicitly labeled zimg/zscale backend with
the approved halo, alpha and packing boundary. Managed pixels stay exact; native
rounding tolerances remain the frozen per-case bounds in the evidence. Tight
bicubic rows allow only input + output + 4 KiB local workspace.

References are pinned FFmpeg n8.1 and its libwebp 1.6.0 backend. Grayscale JPEG
uses the approved standalone **SIMD libjpeg-turbo 3.1.4.1** exception; lossless
WebP uses **libwebp exact=1** to preserve hidden RGB. Defaults/quality numbers
across encoders are not assumed equivalent. Startup, concurrency, GIF/animation
and unlisted content/settings are excluded.

[Measurement instructions](../benchmarks/README.md) and the deferred
[finite coverage objective](../benchmarks/WARM-COVERAGE.md) retain reproducibility
and outstanding work. Rebuild this summary with
`python benchmarks/render-benchmark.py`; verify it with `--check`.
